# Multiplication table
"""
Your task, is to create NÃ—N multiplication table, of size provided in parameter.
For example, when given size is 3:
1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9
should return [[1,2,3],[2,4,6],[3,6,9]]
"""
# Parameters or Edge Cases:
"""
    inputs will be integers greater than 0
    inputs will not be empty
"""
# Return:
"""
    a 2d array representing a multiplication table where the input both the number of arrays inside the 2d array and elements in each array
"""
# Examples:
"""
    1 => [[1]]
    2 => [[1, 2], [2, 4]]
    3 => [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]]
    4 => [[1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 4, 6, 8], [3, 6, 9, 12], [4, 8, 12, 16]]
    5 => [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], [3, 6, 9, 12, 15], [4, 8, 12, 16, 20], [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]]
