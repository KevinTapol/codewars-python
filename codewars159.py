# Twice as old
"""
Your function takes two arguments:
current father's age (years)
current age of his son (years)
Ğ¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old). The answer is always greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.
"""
# Parameters or Edge Cases:
"""
inputs will be integers
"""
# Return:
"""
the age where the first input would be double the second input when scaled either backwards or forwards or 0
"""
# Examples:
"""
    (36,7) => 22
    (55,30) => 5
    (42,21) => 0
    (22,1) => 20
    (29,0) => 29
"""
# Pseudocode:
"""
    # subtract the 1st input by the product of the 2 times the 2nd input
    # return the absolute value of the difference
